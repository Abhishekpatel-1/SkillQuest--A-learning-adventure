🚀 SkillQuest – A Learning Adventure

SkillQuest is a gamified community learning platform that transforms traditional group learning into an engaging, collaborative, and rewarding experience. It motivates learners using quests, XP, levels, badges, and leaderboards, while real-time community interaction encourages peer learning.

Built using Google Cloud and Firebase, SkillQuest ensures secure authentication, real-time updates, and scalable performance.

🎯 Problem Statement

Learning thrives in communities, but many existing platforms feel isolating, overly academic, and unengaging. Basic leaderboards are not enough to sustain motivation, and learners often lack collaboration and a sense of progress.

SkillQuest addresses this by introducing game mechanics and social interaction into community learning.

💡 Solution Overview

SkillQuest converts learning into a quest-based journey where students:

Complete learning challenges

Earn XP, levels, and badges

Collaborate with peers in real time

Track progress through leaderboards and skill indicators

The platform combines gamification, social learning, and AI-powered assistance to improve engagement, consistency, and skill mastery.
